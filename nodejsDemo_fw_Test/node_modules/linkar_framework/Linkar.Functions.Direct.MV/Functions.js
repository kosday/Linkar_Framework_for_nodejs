			filename - (string) File name to read.
			recordIds - (string) A list of item IDs to read, separated by the Record Separator character (30). Use <StringFunctions.ComposeRecordIds> to compose this string
			dictionaries - (string) List of dictionaries to read, separated by space. If this list is not set, all fields are returned.
			readOptions - (<ReadOptions>) Object that defines the different reading options of the Function: Calculated, dictClause, conversion, formatSpec, originalRecords.
			customVars - (string)Free text sent to the database allows management of additional behaviours in SUB.LK.MAIN.CONTROL.CUSTOM, which is called when this parameter is set.
