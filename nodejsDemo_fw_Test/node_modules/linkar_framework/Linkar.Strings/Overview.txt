Title: Library Overview

Set of functions that help manipulate the character strings that are used as input and output data in MV type operations (Linkar.Functions.Direct.MV and Linkar.Functions.Persistent.MV libraries).
For example, functions that help lists of record IDs, lists of records, argument lists to be composed for subroutine operations, and in-verse functions that help elements from the responses of operations and from the result lists, etc. to be extract-ed.
