Title: Library Overview

There are several sets of auxiliary functions in this library.

Some of them help to compose the arguments that the Primitives need so as to execute the operations.

Auxiliary functions also allow the creation of different options for each operation.

Another group of functions allows the use of typical MV Database operations, such as Count, DCount, Replace, Change, â€¦
