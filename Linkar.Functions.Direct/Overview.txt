This library consists of one function for each possible operation in Linkar Server (Read, New, Update, Select, Subroutine, ...)

The executed operation is a Direct type one.

The desired output format can be specified in these operations, and the data input format can also be specified in those operations that also allow it.

The basic input and output formats are XML, JSON, MV, or TABLE.

Different formats for data input and output can also be speci-fied.

Not all operations allow input/output type formats.
